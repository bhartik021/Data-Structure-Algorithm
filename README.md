### Data Structure
Data structure is a particular way of sorting and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. A data structure is a special format for organizing and storing data. General data strucutre types include arrays, files, linked list, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and so om.

Depending on the organization of the elements, data structures are classified into types:

* Linear data structures: Elements are accesed in a sequential order but it is not compulsory to store all elements sequentially. examples: linked lists, stacks, queues.
* Non-linear data structures: Elements of this data structure are stored/accessed in a non-linear order. Examples: Trees and graphs.
